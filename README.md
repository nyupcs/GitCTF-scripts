# Git-based CTF Tools

This directory contains several tools for automating ```Git-based CTF```. You
can start playing around with them by running `./gitctf.py` or `./gitctf.py
help`.

### Prerequisite

Our tools assume that you have installed `GPG`, `Git`, `unzip`, `nc`, as well as
`python` on your system. Currently our tool relies on two external python
libraries: `requests` and `python-dateutil`.

### How to start?

Type `./gitctf.py help` to see the help.
